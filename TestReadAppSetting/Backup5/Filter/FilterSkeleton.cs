	/// <summary>
	/// Users should extend this class to implement customized logging
	/// event filtering. Note that <see cref="Category"/> and 
	/// <see cref="log4net.Appender.AppenderSkeleton"/>, the parent class of all standard
	/// appenders, have built-in filtering rules. It is suggested that you
	/// first use and understand the built-in rules before rushing to write
	/// your own custom filters.
	/// </summary>
	/// <remarks>
	/// <p>This abstract class assumes and also imposes that filters be
	/// organized in a linear chain. The <see cref="Decide"/>
	/// method of each filter is called sequentially, in the order of their 
	/// addition to the chain.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>The <see cref="Decide"/> method must return one
	/// of the integer constants DENY, NEUTRAL or ACCEPT.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>If the value DENY is returned, then the log event is dropped 
	/// immediately without consulting with the remaining filters. </p>
	/// 
	/// <p>If the value NEUTRAL is returned, then the next filter
	/// in the chain is consulted. If there are no more filters in the
	/// chain, then the log event is logged. Thus, in the presence of no
	/// filters, the default behaviour is to log all logging events.</p>
	/// 
	/// <p>If the value ACCEPT is returned, then the log
	/// event is logged without consulting the remaining filters. </p>
	/// 
	/// <p>The philosophy of log4net filters is largely inspired from the
	/// Linux ipchains. </p>
